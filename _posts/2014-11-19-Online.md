After some years I decided to turn off my DNN site at [http://albe.ihnet.it](http://albe.ihnet.it), and to maintain a simpler personal site thanks to Github Pages.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/homeview.png" alt="AL" style="width:600px; max-width:100%;" />

##Goodbye Dnn
The DNN site will soon be closed, but I'll port relevant content to this new site.
I'm not planning to deploy a new Dnn site atm.

##Welcome jekyll, thanks Github 
This site is static html generated with [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and (freely! :beer:) hosted at Github by their [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) service.
